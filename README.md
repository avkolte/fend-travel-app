# Travel App

This capstone project aims to give us the opportunity to put all of the skills we have learned into one project to build our own custom travel app. It is all done in a Webpack environment, using an Express server, and wrapped up with service workers.

## How To Start

- Clone this repo
- `cd` into your new folder and run `npm install` to install npm packages
- Open a terminal at the root level of the project
- Type `npm run build` to generate `dist` 
- Type `npm run start` to run the server at port 8080
- To run the server in development mode, type `npm run dev`
- Type `npm run test` to run the test cases

## Deploying

I tried deploying the app on Netlify
It's live at `https://naughty-brown-d13208.netlify.app/`
